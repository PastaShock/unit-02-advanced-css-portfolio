                Hello,
                I'm an aspiring developer delving into the deep dark depths of computer programming.
                My first scripting language was HTML that I learned in a high school class taught by a basketball coach. Needless to say, I did not learn much and the curriculum was already far out of date.
                <br>
                Later I got into programming in C++ on arduinos making all sorts of odd contraptions.
                But once I was out of community college I got a job and was far too busy with work to be able to have any projects like that.
                later, in another job I found myself in a company that was rapidly growing. I had tasks that were repetitive and unnecessarily convoluted. So I set out to create scripts in VBA for Excel to make my workflow more efficient. From there I took that VB experience and translated it to Powershell to facilitate the organization of files and folders that everything I worked with would go. I sped up the searching of files by an order of magnitude, at least. In Powershell I developed skills that allowed me to hop into javascript. so you could say:
                I have been fiddling with js.
                <br>
                In javascript I wrote scripts that manipulated a webpage to take over tasks that I would otherwise be clicking around in manually. I parsed information, made many conditional statements, used nested JS objects, created and exported JSON files to Powershell among other basic things.
                When I developed my JS skills further, I used JSON in Powershell to take information from a webpage and make it usable in my prior scripts. I set up a lot of logging and tracking of my (regular day-to-day) work and, on the side, I've kept maintaining an updating code since
