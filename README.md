## Homework 2
### Advanced CSS

The goal of this homework was to create a page similar in functionality to the reference animation given.

I chose to imitate it's style with a few modifications.

I wrote myself a long winded biography of my programming and scripting experience

I don't have any presentable projects, so I used placeholder images and they link to google. The titles and descriptions are also placeholders, not referencing any existing project, at least on purpose. 

I got links to a couple of social media and social-adjacent platforms that I use and linked them to my own profiles.

### Update february 2022
I have gone and updated the page with our project 1 as the hero/jumbotron.
I went and added some of the homework projects in the placeholder slots.
I made minor tweaks to the css to better fit and space the content.
